    <h1> What is steaganography ?</h1>
    <p>Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information <br/> within non-secret data, such as images, audio files, or text, to conceal its existence. Unlike encryption, which scrambles data to make it unreadable without a key, steganography embeds the hidden message in a way that it appears normal, making it difficult to detect. It is often used for secure communication, digital watermarking, and data protection.</p>
